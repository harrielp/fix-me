# Fix Me
A tactical media piece critiquing the pitfalls of ableist American education and pharmaceutical companies in 'manufacturing' the perfect, neurotypical child. 

The American public school system doesn’t nurture intellectual diversity and often prioritizes hierarchy, which puts unbelievable pressure among kids who don’t follow the ‘ideal’ model. These institutions have really propagated this stigmatized, 'fix-your-child' attitude that really should be talked more about. 

I touch upon the topic of stimulants in this project, but in no way am I saying that medication itself is harmful — I am solely critiquing how healthcare institutions perpetuate harmful incentives for children to go on medication when these children don’t even fully understand themselves yet. It's just like how big pharma monetizes and advertises ADHD medication as a way for kids to do better in school and at socializing. 

With this website/web experience, I wanted to exploit and simulate the cycle of feeling the need to be 'fixed' as a young neurodivergent child and those extreme feelings of alienation and anxiety that come along with it.
